# v1.7.3 — Repo-Wide Responsive CSS Scaffold

**Branch:** `chore/css-mobile-scaffold`
**Commit:** `chore(v1.7.3): repo-wide responsive css scaffold + docs addendum`
**Type:** Organization only — no behavior changes, no selector or property value edits.

## Summary

Applied a consistent five-section responsive structure across all CSS files in the Chaos Portal style system. This pass was purely organizational: existing blocks were grouped under section headings; no rules were created, removed, or modified.

---

## Section Structure

Every file now contains the following five section headings (comments), in this order:

```
/* ── Base (all viewports) ─────────────────────────────────────── */
/* ── Desktop / Large ──────────────────────────────────────────── */
/* ── Tablet ───────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
/* ── Phone / iPhone ───────────────────────────────────────────── */
/* ── Touch (hover:none) and (pointer:coarse) ──────────────────── */
```

Existing media queries were placed under the appropriate heading. Files with no breakpoints received the headings with `/* No [X]-specific overrides. */` notes under each empty section.

---

## Files: Previously Scaffolded (checked, section headings added)

These files had scaffold work done earlier on this branch. This pass verified their breakpoint coverage and added the standard section heading labels where they were absent.

| File | What was added |
|------|---------------|
| `src/styles/components/expanding-cards.css` | Added `Desktop / Large`, `Tablet`, `Phone / iPhone`, `Touch` headings; existing `@media (max-width: 900px)` grouped under Phone/iPhone |
| `src/styles/patterns/dimension-card.css` | Added all five section headings; no media queries in file |
| `src/styles/patterns/layout.css` | Added all five section headings; existing `@media (max-width: 768px)` grouped under Phone/iPhone |

---

## Files: Updated in This Pass

Full five-section scaffold applied to all remaining CSS files.

### `src/styles/components/`

| File | Existing breakpoints moved under heading |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| `accordion.css` | None — all sections are stubs |
| `coordinate-picker.css` | `@media (max-width: 600px)` → Phone / iPhone |
| `flip-card.css` | None — all sections are stubs |
| `tabs.css` | `@media (max-width: 600px)` → Phone / iPhone |

### `src/styles/patterns/`

| File | Existing breakpoints moved under heading |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| `breadcrumb.css` | None — all sections are stubs |
| `callouts.css` | None — all sections are stubs |
| `cards.css` | None — all sections are stubs |
| `content.css` | None — all sections are stubs |
| `hero.css` | `@media (max-width: 768px)` → Phone / iPhone |
| `section-nav.css` | `@media (max-width: 600px)` → Phone / iPhone |
| `tags.css` | None — all sections are stubs |

### Root style files

| File | Existing breakpoints moved under heading |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| `src/styles/base.css` | None — all sections are stubs |
| `src/styles/tokens.css` | None — all sections are stubs |
| `src/styles/global.css` | `@media (max-width: 768px)` (site-header + typography) → Phone / iPhone |

---

## Breakpoint Values Reference

Breakpoint values already present in the codebase were preserved exactly as-is. No new values were introduced.

| Value | Used in |
|-------|---------|
| `max-width: 600px` | coordinate-picker.css, tabs.css, section-nav.css |
| `max-width: 768px` | expanding-cards.css (base), hero.css, layout.css, global.css |
| `max-width: 900px` | expanding-cards.css (slotted vertical axis) |

---

## Statement

**No behavior changes; organization only.** All selectors, property values, cascade order, and imports are identical to the pre-scaffold state. This pass adds comment headings and groups existing `@media` blocks under the appropriate heading within each file. No CSS was moved across files.

---

## Future Note

**Flatten nested container chrome only inside ExpandingCards slotted mode.** The `.compass-content` wrapper currently wraps `.expanding-cards--slotted` on the Vertical Axis expanding-cards page, applying surface/shadow/border chrome that doubles with the card container's own chrome. A future cleanup pass should evaluate removing the outer `.compass-content` wrapper (or using a bare/transparent variant) in slotted mode only. This is a visual cleanup, not a structural change, and should be deferred until the slotted layout is fully stable across breakpoints.
